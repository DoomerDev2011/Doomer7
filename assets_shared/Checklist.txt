- Get hud/images/text/crosshair to scale properly down on different resolutions
- Create eye compass
- Get eye health bar functionality working 
- Animation/reload timing cleanup
- Bobbing cleanup (make sure the frames don't show blank spaces)
- Add in Doom Mode and Killer7/8 mode for players to choose at the start of the game
 -- Doom Mode plays like Doom (regular Doom movement speed for every persona, can aim and fire freely without holding space, difficulty options will be
	Doom's regular difficulty options)
 -- Killer7 mode plays like Killer7(each character has different movement speeds, need to hold space to fire, enemies will be heaven smiles when completed,
	difficulty options will be Killer7's difficulty options)
 -- Killer8 (same as Killer7 mode, but enemies one shot you, and only has the one killer8 difficulty)
- Figure out how thin blood will work within the game and how to balance it
